# Resources

Helpful resources to learn a little bit more about the HELK and its components.

# Goals

* Gather as many resources as I can about the components of the HELK to share them with the community all at once.
* Share interesting/valuable resources that helped me and , hopefully, could help others to learn more about ELK, Spark, Kafka, Jupyter, etc.

# Kafka
